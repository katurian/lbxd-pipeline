Once Cate or Rooney delivers a line, Todd continues filming for five or so beats before cutting away to the next frame. He does this because he wants you to really bask in whatever emotion that extended shot (a mutual gaze, a flushed smile) is supposed to evoke.\u00a0Here,\u00a0the intended effect is romantic tension. Todd creates an air of almost criminal suspense around Therese and Carol\u2019s blooming relationship, but it doesn\u2019t feel insidious to us because we are anticipating something positive: love.\n\nIn <i>Safe</i>, however, the effect is what I can only describe as horror. As we watch Carol White\u2019s slow (but inevitable) suffocation run its course, Todd subjects us to these painful, prolonged shots of Carol wheezing, sobbing, enduring unwanted sex, or just simply existing\u00a0in a space that is eating her alive. And\u00a0<i>Safe\u00a0</i>does not allow you the luxury of wincing away from such things. You experience every moment of Carol\u2019s quiet suffering unedited, as if you yourself are not watching it, but there experiencing it vicariously.

He does this because he wants you to really bask in whatever emotion that extended shot (a mutual gaze, a flushed smile) is supposed to evoke.\u00a0Here,\u00a0the intended effect is romantic tension.

Robin Campillo understands this concept, and his familiarity with the subject matter made everything political in <i>Battements par Minute</i> feel so so personal. <i>ACT UP</i>'s rich support network is a family as much as it is an activist group, the cause that Sean fights for is literally his survival, etc. Even the visual style evokes this idea. Each moment of the film is presented with such bright, loud, subjective intensity, except for of course the scenes meant to show Sean's decline. Campillo captures the transience of being gay in the early 90s, how AIDS bound people to each other and galvanized them to fight for generations they would never meet.</p><blockquote><p>There are moments in which I realize how AIDS has changed my life.

Case point: three-quarters of its run-time is expository, Lisbeth and Mikael gathering clues that build up to the climax. Yet it doesn\u2019t bore me like traditional depictions of investigation do, because David doesn't hold our hand throughout the whole process. He doesn't tell the audience what his characters are thinking by means of bloated dialogue, but shows it visually.

You see that for many of these sisters, God is a dreary substitute for what they desire in their secular lives: someone who loves them unconditionally.

Unfortunately <i>Novitiate</i>\u00a0chooses neither of these options.\r\n\r\nThe film dedicates a good 40 minutes to exploring the origin of Catherine\u2019s religious devotion, but it fails miserably. They sort of imply that she was isolated from her peers. They sort of imply that she experienced spiritual euphoria as a child. They sort of imply she has daddy issues. They sort of imply that nunhood offered an escape from womanhood.

As a result, the audience never really \u201cgets\u201d why she starves herself, why she deprives herself of intimacy, why she wants to spend her life at the convent, etc. because we don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s desperate for God\u2019s love in the first place.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMargaret Qualley\u2019s performance just isn\u2019t weird enough to pull off such a weird character.

It\u2019s morbid, erotic, thoughtful, and absolutely genius.\r\n\r\nFlorence Pugh gives a masterclass in acting despite being only 19 during the film\u2019s 2015 production. She plays a weirdly apathetic English mistress, Catherine Leicester, who lives on an estate that I assume is somewhere \u201coup\u201d north based on the accent Pugh takes on. Maybe the Scottish Highlands? She says \u201caway\u201d like \u201cooweey\u201d and \u201ctake\u201d like \u201ctehk\u201d.\u00a0\r\n\r\n<i>Lady Macbeth</i>\u00a0turns that popular \u201cwhite girl boss\u201d movie premise on its head, wherein white women reject sexist society in a raceless, classless, asexual vacuum. Think <i>Mona Lisa Smile</i> or <i>The Beguiled</i>. But the film\u00a0doesn\u2019t just acknowledge this trope, this discrepancy between films and reality. It takes a step further, towards bitter satire.\r\n\r\nCatherine uses people who are also oppressed by society,\u00a0but for entirely different reasons, be it race or class. Brown and poor people are stepping stones on her path to autonomy and self-indulgence, which is, ironically, also how white men treat Mrs Leicester. Her husband uses her nude body to masturbate; her father-in-law \u201cbought\u201d Catherine for the land his family would inherit from their marriage; and of course, she is needed to produce a male heir who would have a greater claim to the Leicester estate.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCatherine wants to be free of these duties pushed onto her, but without losing her status as a relatively wealthy, landowning white woman in 19th century England. In other words, it\u2019s not just plain agency she\u2019s after. She wants the privilege white men have, to claim what they want\u2014sex, wine, sleep, leisure\u2014without consequence.\u00a0And that is where the intersectionality of <i>Lady Macbeth </i>lies<i>. </i>Catherine\u00a0is simultaneously the oppressed because of her sex and the oppressor because the hedonistic lifestyle she wants to lead depends on subjugating people of a certain class and race. Her freedom encroaches on the freedom of others.\u00a0\r\n\r\nYet the film initially wants to endear you to Catherine. What we later recognize as borderline sociopathic tendencies seems like a stick-it-to-the-man pluckiness at first. Her disregard for society\u2019s rules is almost charming, until it extends to rules that maybe ought to be respected. Like, caring for others somewhat and not murdering innocents. Many reviewers see <i>Lady Macbeth </i>as the progress of Catherine\u2019s moral decline, but I think assuming she ever had a moral compass plays into the biases about white women that this film is trying to expose.

This is definitely a film you will think back on years after seeing it for the first time.", "containsSpoilers": false, "moderated": false, "whenReviewed": "2019-12-26T05:29:36Z", "text": "<p>This is a slow, dreadful burn with no OST, just the diegetic sounds of waterfalls, wet kissing, wind in trees, etc. Shots are held long so we really soak in the horror of what\u2019s taking place, and characters\u2019 corresponding reactions. It\u2019s morbid, erotic, thoughtful, and absolutely genius.</p><p>Florence Pugh gives a masterclass in acting despite being only 19 during the film\u2019s 2015 production. She plays a weirdly apathetic English mistress, Catherine Leicester, who lives on an estate that I assume is somewhere \u201coup\u201d north based on the accent Pugh takes on. Maybe the Scottish Highlands? She says \u201caway\u201d like \u201cooweey\u201d and \u201ctake\u201d like \u201ctehk\u201d.\u00a0</p><p><i>Lady Macbeth</i>\u00a0turns that popular \u201cwhite girl boss\u201d movie premise on its head, wherein white women reject sexist society in a raceless, classless, asexual vacuum. Think <i>Mona Lisa Smile</i> or <i>The Beguiled</i>. But the film\u00a0doesn\u2019t just acknowledge this trope, this discrepancy between films and reality. It takes a step further, towards bitter satire.</p><p>Catherine uses people who are also oppressed by society,\u00a0but for entirely different reasons, be it race or class. Brown and poor people are stepping stones on her path to autonomy and self-indulgence, which is, ironically, also how white men treat Mrs Leicester. Her husband uses her nude body to masturbate; her father-in-law \u201cbought\u201d Catherine for the land his family would inherit from their marriage; and of course, she is needed to produce a male heir who would have a greater claim to the Leicester estate.\u00a0</p><p>Catherine wants to be free of these duties pushed onto her, but without losing her status as a relatively wealthy, landowning white woman in 19th century England. In other words, it\u2019s not just plain agency she\u2019s after. She wants the privilege white men have, to claim what they want\u2014sex, wine, sleep, leisure\u2014without consequence.\u00a0And that is where the intersectionality of <i>Lady Macbeth </i>lies<i>. </i>Catherine\u00a0is simultaneously the oppressed because of her sex and the oppressor because the hedonistic lifestyle she wants to lead depends on subjugating people of a certain class and race. Her freedom encroaches on the freedom of others.\u00a0</p><p>Yet the film initially wants to endear you to Catherine. What we later recognize as borderline sociopathic tendencies seems like a stick-it-to-the-man pluckiness at first. Her disregard for society\u2019s rules is almost charming, until it extends to rules that maybe ought to be respected. Like, caring for others somewhat and not murdering innocents. Many reviewers see <i>Lady Macbeth </i>as the progress of Catherine\u2019s moral decline, but I think assuming she ever had a moral compass plays into the biases about white women that this film is trying to expose. It\u2019s much more likely that Catherine was always manipulative and apathetic, just leashed in like a dog about to bite.\u00a0</p><p><i>Lady Macbeth </i>is too ambiguous to firmly speculate about any aspect of it, however.
